Tools used : python 3.8,django,django rest framework,sqlite3,postman,git,github,swagger,smtp,JWT authentication.
I have create rest api's of signup,login,update password,reset and forgot password and also use JWT authentication in login.
I have removed my credentials from smtp server as of now for security purpose ,if we put credentials of verified gmail account id and password in smtp then email will work fine.
I have also use swagger for reset and forgot password api's testing.
I have test all the api's in postman and swagger.
